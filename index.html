    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A 24/7 &TEAM enthusiast with a heart full of love for LUNÉ and a camera roll full of screenshots I’ll never delete. I live, breathe, and dream &TEAM, and I’m pretty sure my soul left my body the first time I heard "Under the Skin." They are my children. My life mission is to spread the gospel of &TEAM to anyone who will listen (and even those who won’t). Whether it’s analyzing every frame of their MVs, defending my bias in fan wars, or crying over their TikTok challenges, I’m fully committed to this fangirl life. My ultimate goal? To attend every &TEAM concert(even though i never will given where i live😭) and maybe—just maybe—get Fuma in a dress (he is my baby girl). Let’s hope we make it to Yerasah safely!</p>
